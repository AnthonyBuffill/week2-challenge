# week2-challenge

In this challenge I was tasked with building a profile from scratch without any starrter code.
This is the beginning stage of my journey to building a custom portfolio which will be used and observed by potential hiring managers.

For my portfolio in the heading at the top of the page I have included a nav bar with hoverable animation.  It does not yet have clickable anchor content attached to it but it will as I accumulate said content

In the projects section in the middle of the page there are links to individual github projects completed since beginning the bootcamp

In the footer of the page I added contact information in the form of hidden hoverable content when hovering over the "phone" and 'email' and a hidden link when hovering over "github"

I recognized that this Portfolio will continue to evolve throughout the course and wil be improved upon in every area assigned or not  Thank you for viewing this project
